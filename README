Project designed using JAX WS framework and integrated MongoDB NoSQL database.

All model classes and ElevatorService.java are located in src/main/java/com/rebecca/elevatorSimulator.

Test suite and all test cases are located in src/main/java/com/rebecca/elevatorSimulator/tests.

Apache Tomcat v8.0 Server was used to run ElevatorService.java.

The URI used to address resources is: http://localhost:8080/elevatorSimulator/webapi/elevatorservice

Postman (an API client) was used to test API's so no need for UI. 

All credentials used to access MongoDB are outlined in ElevatorService.java (lines 42 and 44)

No test cases were created for model classes because they only had getters and setters which did not contain any complex logic.
